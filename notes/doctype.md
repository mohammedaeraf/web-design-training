## ✅ **What is `<!DOCTYPE html>`?**

It is a **declaration** that must be placed at the very **top of every HTML document**, before the `<html>` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 📌 **Why is `<!DOCTYPE html>` Important?**

### 1. 🧠 **Tells the Browser the HTML Version**

- It tells the browser that this document uses **HTML5**, the latest version of HTML.
- Without it, the browser may **fall back to “quirks mode”**, which can cause inconsistent rendering of your page.

---

### 2. 📐 **Enables Standards Mode**

- Browsers have different rendering modes:

  - **Standards Mode**: Follows modern HTML/CSS rules.
  - **Quirks Mode**: Emulates old browser behavior (like IE 5/6).

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` ensures the browser uses **Standards Mode**, which is necessary for your CSS to behave predictably.

---

### 3. ✅ **Helps with Cross-Browser Compatibility**

- Makes your page look the same across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- Without it, you may experience layout or styling issues that are hard to debug.

---

### 4. 💡 **Required for Valid HTML**

- If you're aiming for **W3C Validation** or clean, professional code — this declaration is a must.
