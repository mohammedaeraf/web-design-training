    <h1>Solar System</h1>
    <p>
      🌍 The Solar System is our cosmic neighborhood, made up of the Sun and all
      the objects that orbit it—like planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. ☀️
      At the center sits the Sun, a blazing star that holds everything together
      with its gravity, keeping the planets in their graceful orbits. 🚀 From
      Mercury to Neptune, each planet has its own unique story to tell! Want a
      quick comparison chart of all the planets next?

    <p>
      The Sun is the blazing heart of our Solar System—a massive, glowing ball
      of hot plasma that provides the energy essential for life on Earth.
      Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, it functions as a natural
      nuclear reactor, constantly fusing hydrogen atoms into helium and
      releasing tremendous amounts of light and heat in the process. Although it
      appears to rise and set from our perspective, the Sun remains stationary
      while the Earth orbits around it, anchoring the entire Solar System
      through its immense gravitational pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about 1.39 million kilometers in diameter, the Sun could fit over a
      million Earths inside it. Its surface, known as the photosphere, has an
      average temperature of around 5,500°C, but at its core, temperatures can
      soar to over 15 million°C. Beyond just being a source of warmth and light,
      the Sun influences Earth's climate, powers the water cycle, and drives
      wind patterns. It also plays a key role in the orbits and stability of all
      planets, moons, asteroids, and comets that revolve around it.

    <h3>Features of Sun</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is a medium-sized star classified as a G-type main-sequence star
        (G2V).
      </li>
      <li>Composed mainly of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%).</li>
      <li>
        Produces energy through nuclear fusion—turning hydrogen into helium.
      </li>
      <li>
        Surface temperature is about 5,500°C, while the core reaches a scorching
        15 million°C.
