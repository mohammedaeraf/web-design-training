## **Assignment: Add a Bootstrap Navbar**

**Objective:**
Learn how to use the Bootstrap documentation to implement a responsive navigation bar in your project.

### **Instructions**

1. **Visit Bootstrap Docs:**
   Go to the official Bootstrap documentation:
   [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/)

2. **Choose a Navbar Example:**

   * Browse the examples on the **Navbar** page.
   * Select any style of navbar (e.g., light, dark, with brand, or with dropdown).

3. **Create a New HTML File:**

   * Name it `navbar.html`.
   * Link Bootstrap CSS & JS files (you can use the CDN links from the “Getting Started” page).

4. **Copy & Paste the Navbar Code:**

   * Copy the chosen navbar code from Bootstrap Docs.
   * Paste it inside the `<body>` of your `navbar.html` file.

5. **Customize the Navbar:**

   * Change the **brand name** to your name or your website’s name.
   * Update the **menu items** to “Home”, “About”, “Services”, “Contact”.
   * (Optional) Add a dropdown menu under “Services” with at least 2 items.

6. **Test Responsiveness:**

   * Open the file in your browser.
   * Resize the window or check on your mobile to ensure the navbar collapses into a **hamburger menu**.

✅ **Expected Output:**
A fully functional, mobile-friendly navbar that collapses on smaller screens and expands on larger screens.
