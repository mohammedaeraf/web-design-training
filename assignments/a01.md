## 📝 **Assignment 01: "My Favorite Animal" Card Page**

### 🎯 **Objective:**

Create a simple HTML page to showcase **your favorite animal** using structured content like headings, paragraphs, an image, and a list.

---

### 📚 **Instructions:**

1. Create an HTML page called `favorite-animal.html`.

2. Add a **main heading** using `<h1>` with the name of the animal (e.g., **"The Tiger"**).

3. Use a **subheading** (`<h2>`) for the animal’s habitat or category (e.g., "A Wild Jungle Animal").

4. Below the heading, write a **paragraph** describing the animal in 2–3 sentences.

5. Insert a **relevant image** of the animal using the `<img>` tag.

6. Add a **list** of interesting facts about the animal. You can use either:

   * an **unordered list** (`<ul>`) for general facts, or
   * an **ordered list** (`<ol>`) for steps (like how it hunts, etc.)

7. Wrap everything inside a `<div class="card">` to simulate a card-style layout. 

8. Add basic CSS for the card, image, and text (can be internal using `<style>` in the `<head>`).

9. You may also use Bootstrap Card styles to design the card.
